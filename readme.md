# Kata: Data Munging
Martin Fowler gave me a hard time for Kata02, complaining that it was yet another single-function, academic exercise. Which, or course, it was. So this week let’s mix things up a bit.

Here’s an exercise in three parts to do with real world data. Try hard not to read ahead—do each part in turn.

## Part One: Weather Data
In weather.dat you’ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).
